5D Embroidory 5DOrganizer 9.5.0.0 Windows 10 rendering hotfix / patch
========

5D Embroidory is not working properly on Windows 10. The gui is unusable, scrollbars don't work and fullscreen mode is bugged.
This is caused by CodeJock Skin Framework. This patch will prevent any theme from loading on startup on the main graphical user interface of the application.
Now you can use it on Windows 10 without problems. Why spend another 2k on software if it still works with a small patch..
